## Common Questions
**1. What do you mean by a good code?**  
The attributes of good code:
- follows coding standards, and uses linting for static code quality
- it contains documentation
- low complexity, simple and clear, easy to refactor if it's necessary
- well tested (unit tests and integration test as well) and bug free
- executes quickly, it has well performance

**2. How do you maintain the quality of code on the project?**  
- set up guidlines
- use static code analysis tools with coding standards
- code review
- refactore when it's necessary
- write unit tests, and cover as much code as possible
- avoid to duplicate code
- CI, it will run the test suits

**3. Which code review tools you know/use?**

**4. What is code review in your opinion?**  
Code review is a systematic examamination of cource code. It is responsible to find common mistakes nad improve the quality of software.
Code review practices fall into two main categories: formal code review and lightweight code review.
 - Formal code reviews are the traditional method of review. Formal inspections are extremely thorough and have been proven effective at finding defects in the code under review.
 - Lightweight code review typically requires less overhead than formal code inspections, lightweight reviews are often conducted as part of the normal development process:
   - Over-the-shoulder – one developer looks over the author's shoulder as the latter walks through the code.
   - Pair programming – two authors develop code together at the same workstation, as is common in Extreme Programming.
   - Tool-assisted code review – authors and reviewers use software tools

**5. How you'll setup code review for team of 5 devs with different skillsets?**
